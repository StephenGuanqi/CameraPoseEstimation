# Camera Pose Estimation
Given a QR code pattern and some photos of it taken by iphone 6 from different positions and angles, this program calculates the camera positions in global coordinates and camera roll, pitch and yaw.

Origin of global coordinates is set at the up-left corner of the QR code. The original pattern is 8.8cm x 8.8 cm. The visualization draws line of 10cm long along X, Y and Z axis in the image.

The units in global coordinates is [cm].
